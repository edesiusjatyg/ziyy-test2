# Redis Configuration for LRU Cache Strategy

# Set maximum memory and eviction policy
# Add these configurations to your Redis instance

# Set max memory (adjust based on your needs, e.g., 256MB)
maxmemory 20mb

# Set LRU eviction policy
# allkeys-lru: evict any key according to LRU algorithm
# volatile-lru: evict keys with expire time set according to LRU
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Number of keys to sample for LRU eviction (default is 5)
maxmemory-samples 5

# For Redis Cloud, you can set these via the console or CLI:
# redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
# redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory 256mb

# Note: The above commands can be run in the Redis CLI to apply the settings immediately.
